For evaluating reproducibility, we start from files ending in unfiltered-3.bed.
We filter for sites that are covered by at least 5 reads in each file. 
Then we further filter for sites that have overlap with at least one other replicate
We also require stopped reads * stopped ratio >= 1.5 in each replicate.
Finally we overlap these sites with the files ending with filter-2.bed to obtain stopped sites in each replicate.
